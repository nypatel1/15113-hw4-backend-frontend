# AI Tool Usage Log

Used Claude 3.5 Sonnet

## Key Prompts That Shaped Implementation

### 1. 
"I want to add a text box to my website that allows visitors to chat with an AI version of myself. I would like the website to connect to a python service on render.com that uses the chatGPT API. Can you show what the python code looks like, along with an html file that implements the frontend?"

**Output:** Initial Flask backend with OpenAI integration and HTML chat interface

### 2. Debugging Deployment Issues
**Prompt:** "I get the error: Sorry, there was an error processing your message. Please try again., when trying to use the chatbot"

Key Issues Identified:
- API URL configuration in frontend
- OpenAI API authentication
- Error handling and debugging strategies

### 3. Python Version Compatibility
Prompt: Shared Render deployment logs showing Python 3.14 incompatibility

Solution Implemented:
- Added `.python-version` file
- Set `PYTHON_VERSION` environment variable
- Configured Render to use Python 3.11

### 4. OpenAI Library Version Conflicts
Prompt: Shared error logs showing `TypeError: Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'`

Solutions Implemented:
- Updated OpenAI library from 0.27.8 to 1.54.0
- Changed from old API syntax (`openai.ChatCompletion.create`) to new syntax (`client.chat.completions.create`)
- Pinned httpx version to 0.27.2 to resolve dependency conflicts

### 5. Security Best Practices
**Prompt:** Discussion about exposed API key in chat

Lessons Learned:
- Never share API keys publicly
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Revoke and regenerate keys if exposed

### 6. Documentation
Prompt: Request for README explaining backend functionality, communication patterns, setup instructions, and security practices

Output: Comprehensive README.md with detailed documentation
